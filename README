This is a Django web application for displaying XPCOM interfaces and their
differences across multiple application versions. Add it to a regular Django
setup, normally the app is called xpcomref.

A script (buildapi) builds the database for the web application using data
provided from built versions of the application and the original source code.

Data about applications must be gathered by dropping dumpcomponents.js into the
application's components directory and then running the application with a clean
profile. After startup an "apislurp" directory will be created on the desktop
and a series of files written there. The component will log its progress to the
standard text console. Once completed the application should be quit as it may
have become unstable. These data files, along with any xpt file shipped with the
application should be placed into the applications directory as follows:

applications
- <Application name>
  - <Application version>
    - platform (contains the version of the platform this app is based on)
    - <OS>
      - application (built by dumpcomponents.js)
      - components (built by dumpcomponents.js)
      - interfaces (built by dumpcomponents.js)
      - compreg.dat (built by dumpcomponents.js)
      - xpti.dat (built by dumpcomponents.js)
      - *.xpt (copied from the application)

There should also be a source directory as follows:

sources
- platform
  - <Platform version> (matches the text in the platform file in the applications directory)
    - source (contains the URL where the source code can be viewed)
    - full copy of the source idls for this version of the platform

These directories only need exist on one machine to build the initial database.
Running the "buildapi" script will scan these directories and generate the
database which may then be transferred to a webhost.

The following is probably necessary in Django's root urls.py:

urlpatterns = patterns('',
  (r'^(?P<path>(?:images|styles|silk|scripts)/.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {'document_root': 'xpcomref'}),
  (r'', include('apislurp.xpcomref.urls'))
)
